    "content": "About Us Origins Stoigela is a company that was born out of necessity, has found its inspiration in historical data, its development rooted in curiosity, and its formulation grounded in scientific evidence. This culminated in the development of Stoigela’s premium Zoilevium collection. Born out of necessity: In 2012 the founders of Stoigela took note of the unspoken pandemic that was already wreaking havoc in the world and was being touted as one of the biggest threats to human health in future, namely antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The rise of superbugs and the fact that antibiotics are increasingly losing the fight against resistant pathogens, have prompted the World Health Organization to describe AMR as one of the top public health and development threats globally. With the world urgently searching for a solution to the AMR threat, Stoigela decided to research alternative solutions to the problem. Inspired by historical data: Research into alternative antimicrobial agents revealed that trace minerals have been a common antimicrobial agent and source of medicinal applications since ancient times. This reality has for example convinced Professor Michael G. Schmidt, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Medical University of South Carolina, to refer to Copper as “truly a gift from Mother Nature, in that the human race has been using it for over eight millennia.\" From historical records, it became evident that the use of trace minerals as antimicrobials is nothing new. Unfortunately, trace minerals fell out of favour with the discovery of antibiotics and antiseptics. Development rooted in curiosity: Based on the historical evidence and driven by a curious demeanour, the research turned towards trace minerals as a next-generation metallo-antibiotic and well-being contributor. In a certain sense Newton's third law of motion, namely Action and Reaction, inspired the development of the Zoilevium product range. Newton’s law represents a certain symmetry in nature. The law states that for every force in nature, there is an equal and opposite force (or counterforce). The argument simply was that if this is true for all motion in the universe, maybe it can apply to living things too. Maybe nature created pathogens but simultaneously created the antidote as well. In our opinion that antidote is trace minerals and vitamins. Formulations grounded in scientific evidence: After 12 years of experimenting with various combinations and blending processes and over 5,000 laboratory efficacy tests, the magical formulation and blending processes were discovered and refined. With numerous external scientific and academical published and peer-reviewed research as backing, we are more than confident in the quality and efficacy of our Zoilevium Trace Mineral Product Range. The academical research shows that the use of metal-based products as an antimicrobial, is not new science, it is only forgotten science. Maybe paraphrasing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes might be in order - When you have eliminated the impossible (trying over and over to create new antibiotics that just aren’t working), whatever remains (a new-old metal-based approach), however improbable, must be the truth. For Interest's Sake The operating company’s name, \"Stoigela\", is derived from a combination of Greek and Latin words, conveying the connotation \"Elements of Life\". The product range, \"Zoilevium\", is also derived from a combination of Greek and Latin words, signifying \"New discoveries are the Essence of Life.\" Our Goal Our goal is to help people to pre-emptively act against various pathogens and ailments by using the innate attributes of trace minerals to: Support their immune systems; Act as antimicrobial agent against unwanted pathogens; Help fight infections, and Improve and support various metabolic functions. We trust that we will become a household name in your home. Thank you for your patronage. Be healthy!"

    "content": "Research GENERAL BACKGROUND The following institutions tested the Zoilevium range of products for safety: Onderstepoort Biological Products SOC Ltd. No adverse findings were reported. IDEXX Laboratories. No adverse findings were reported. Bureau Veritas. Products adhere to SANS241 standard for healthy potable water. General well-being implies a situation where one is generally “not sick”. The human body does however seem to be a target-rich environment for attacks from sources, foreign and/or domestic, so to speak. Bacteria, viruses, pathogens, cancers, autoimmune diseases, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia, and many other “enemies” are constantly looking for ways to attack our bodies. Our only natural defence against these attacks is our immune system. The immune system performs a vital role in protecting our bodies from harmful substances, like germs and cell changes that could make you ill. Without an immune system, we would have no way of fighting harmful pathogens that enter our bodies from the outside or harmful changes that occur inside our bodies.1 Main Tasks of the Immune System The main tasks of the body’s immune system are:1 to fight disease-causing pathogens like bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi, to recognize and neutralize harmful substances from the environment, and to fight disease-causing changes in the body, such as cancer cells. The Covid-19 outbreak was so widespread and devastating that it highlighted how vulnerable we are to attacks from such pathogens. To make things worse, the new generation of pathogens (for our purposes specifically bacteria and viruses), are becoming more and more resistant to conventional medicines and antibiotics. This is becoming so prevalent that these pathogens have earned the nickname of super-bugs. This drug resistance is referred to as antimicrobial resistance or AMR.2 Where Covid-19 is estimated to have claimed close to 7 million lives to date (February 2024), AMR claimed around 5 million lives in 2019 alone and is projected to potentially claim up to 10 million lives annually by 2050, and this figure is already starting to look low3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . Joshi says that, next to climate change, AMR is the most urgent global healthcare challenge the human species is facing.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, So why is the discussion about AMR and immune systems important? Well, because one factor jeopardising our general well-being is the impact of AMR on our health. Case in point being Covid-19 or stubborn infections that just won’t respond to antibiotics. A second factor in our general well-being is the resilience of our immune systems. The stronger our immune systems are, the better they can protect us against constant attacks from harmful pathogens. This dual risk factor reasoning prompted the development of the Zoilevium product range. The approach was based on the following logic: If the immune system can be boosted, it will be beneficial to our general well-being, and If tenacious, drug-resistant pathogens can be combatted, general well-being can be improved. A range of 3 Zoilevium products were developed to speak to these 2 problem areas (immune support and AMR support). All Zoilevium products are mineral-based products. All amounts of minerals in the products are below accepted recommended dietary allowances (RDAs). The products have also been tested against the SANS 241 standard for safe potable water, and have been found to be within the prescribed allowable ranges. But why go the minerals route to address the 2 problem areas, one might ask? The value of minerals to the body is well-known and not disputed. Minerals are not required in great amounts in our bodies, yet play very significant biological roles and are essential for life15, 16, . Minerals and Vitamins, also called micronutrients, are the building blocks for good health. They are critical for several important bodily functions. They support and improve numerous coenzymes and cofactors and play a vital role in the processes of energy production. People who do not have enough of these essential nutrients develop micronutrient malnutrition, which can have devastating consequences. Micronutrients are vital to healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being.17 The products’ efficacy relies on the following inherent and undisputed properties of the minerals used in our products: Their natural antimicrobial properties which may help the body combat unwanted infections. Their natural contribution to improvement and support of the body’s immune system.17 Their natural innate contributions to the body’s normal functioning and overall general well-being.17 There is sound academic and scientific research and evidence to substantiate the confidence we have in the value that our products may be able to add as an augmentation to a normal medical treatment regime and/or daily supplement, as well as for the contribution our products may be able to make in assisting the body in dealing with the improvement of general well-being. As such, our products are to be viewed and used as supplements to assist with areas of well-being they have been designed for. We believe that our formulations, combinations, and processes in producing our products are unique and the basis of the confidence in our products we espouse. One example is the boom around the use of a Zinc supplement to general health. The facts are however that just using a Zinc supplement may lead to a Copper deficiency. Similarly, a too high intake of Copper (through supplementation or via normal dietary intake) can cause a Zinc deficiency. Both deficiencies have their own negative impact on the body and general health. Scientific literature suggests that it is important to strike an optimally balanced ratio between Zinc and Copper intake. Copper and Zinc work together in processes such as immune response, nervous system function, and healthy digestion. They are, however, antagonists, meaning that as levels of one decreases, the levels of the other increases and vice versa.18, 19 Because this is an important factor in Copper and Zinc supplementation, we have used the most optimal ratio in the formulation of our products to pre-empt this antagonistic relationship. The Zoilevium product range has been divided into 2 categories, namely: Products with the main functionality being to improve the body’s response to AMR, and Products with the main functionality being to boost The 2 categories will now be discussed in greater detail. 1. CATEGORY 1 – PRODUCTS COMBATTING AMR Mineral/Metal-based drugs are inorganic compounds that have been used in medicinal chemistry as therapeutic agents for a long time.20, 21,22 It is now common knowledge that a variety of metal ions are toxic to bacteria and can therefore act as an antibacterial agent.23, 24 These metal complexes have been successfully used as anticancer treatments, anti-inflammatories, antidiabetic drugs, antimicrobial agents and in the treating of specific conditions, such as Diabetes Mellitus, Huntington’s disease, Atherosclerosis and Wilson’s disease, among others.25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 Metal-based compounds have also proven to have remarkable antimicrobial properties and certainly have great potential in the prospective development of a new response to AMR.31, 32, 33 Evans and Kavanagh published a paper in which they investigated the use of metals as antibacterial agents. According to them, metal-based antibacterial compounds have novel modes of action that may provide an advantage in the treatment of bacterial infections with resistance to conventional antibiotics.34, 35, 32, 36 Metal-based compounds are rapidly emerging as an alternative to organic drugs, as they have the ability to kill pathogens via metal-specific modes of action.31, 32 This field of research is developing metal complexes with remarkable actions, and new metal-based drugs are emerging every year.15, 33 An advantage to the use of metal-based antimicrobial approaches is their diverse modes of action compared to conventional organic antibiotics.34, 37, 38, 39, 40 Therefore, the use of these metal-based complexes alone or in combination with antibiotics, holds promise as an effective treatment against resistant bacterial infections through these novel and additional modes of action.34, 35, 37 Some of these novel modes of action include (but are not limited to): The ability to disrupt the protective layers of certain microorganisms and thus interfering with their vital processes. The ability to disrupt bacterial cell membranes, damaging the DNA or RNA of the microbe. The ability to generate ferociously reactive oxidative stress on bacterial cells, which can kill bacteria. The ability to interfere with critical proteins that operate important functions that keep bacterial cells alive. Various minerals in Zoilevium are well known for their antimicrobial properties, therefore the Zoilevium products can be described as mineral-based antimicrobial compounds that are produced by bioinorganic chemistry, and which exhibit the characteristics and modes of action of a broad spectrum, inorganic, metallo-antibiotic.32, 41, 42 The efficacy as antimicrobial agents of our mineral-based products can be seen in the results of the following laboratory test results: All tests were done by AMBIO Environmental Management (Pty) Ltd, a division of the Vaal University of Technology (VUT), an INDEPENDENT and ACCREDITED laboratory. The Lab tests were done to test the efficacy of Zoilevium as an antimicrobial agent. The chart shows how various types of bacteria were incubated until 10,000+ or 100,000+ colonies were present. These colonies of bacteria were then treated with our AMR-based formula. The results after 24 hours show that all bacteria colonies had been totally eradicated. The only sample where there was a minute number of bacteria left, was a blend of 8 different types of bacteria incubated in the same petri dish. The advantage of such an effective antimicrobial supplement is that one’s immune system now has a powerful partner to rely on when combatting unwanted pathogens. This frees up the immune system to get back to basics and focus on keeping the body in a state of general well-being. Conclusions Metal-based antimicrobial complexes have several advantages over conventional antibiotics in that they have multiple and novel modes of action.34, 35 Scientific literature is proliferated with research supporting the potential of metal-based antimicrobial efficacy in the battle against AMR and the prospective advantages that these metal-based compounds may add to the medical field (see bibliography). The reality is that the use of metal-based products as an antimicrobial is not new science, it is only forgotten science.44 Our products use the inherent properties of minerals to increase your body’s immune system, while also assisting in killing unwanted and unwelcome intruders thereby alleviating the immune system's workload. The purpose of this information brief is to give all users of our supplements the confidence and peace of mind that they will be using a product that has been developed with generally accepted scientific and academic views, principles, and methodologies as foundation. (For further in-depth discussions and explanations please refer to the resources as provided in the bibliography.) 1.1 ZOILEVIUM PUREGUT IBS and Gut Health Support Zoilevium PureGut is a mineral-based antimicrobial compound that has the properties and modes of action of a broad spectrum, inorganic, metallo-antibiotic. IBD According to the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation,45 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD with main types being Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis) are two distinct gastrointestinal disorders. The Mayo Clinic46 describes Crohn's disease as a type of IBD which causes swelling of the tissues (inflammation) in the digestive tract. This can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people. The most debilitating thing about Crohn’s disease is that it is believed that there is no known cure.46 The National Health Service (NHS) in Great Britain describes Crohn's disease as a “lifelong condition”.47 The best that the medical fraternity can do is to try and reduce the symptoms and hope for periods of remission where patients can try and lead a semi-normal life. The Zoilevium PureGut IBD & IBS Support explained in 3-steps. Step 1: What causes Crohn’s disease? To understand how Zoilevium PureGut can assist with IBS-related issues, we first need to try and figure out what causes Crohn’s disease. It turns out that nobody really knows. The best anyone can do is speculate. Typical answers you might find when researching the subject are: “The exact cause of Crohn's disease remains unknown.”45 “Doctors aren’t sure what causes Crohn's disease.”48 and, “There’s no known cause of Crohn’s disease.”49 It is extremely difficult to treat something you don’t know the cause of. How do you treat “something” if you don’t know what that “something” is? The best one can then do is treat the symptoms, because you can’t treat what you can’t identify. How do you solve a problem if you don’t know what the problem is? This is exactly what is happening with the current treatments of Crohn’s disease. Symptoms are being treated to alleviate discomfort, but the problem is never addressed and eradicated. Some of the best guesses as to the cause of Crohn’s disease are: A weakened immune system (the body's defence against infection) may lead to bacteria in the digestive tract which may cause the body’s immune system to attack healthy cells in the digestive system (this is called an autoimmune disease).47, 49 Key take-aways: Bacteria and immune system. Heredity. Crohn's disease is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so genes may play a role.46 A previous stomach bug which may open the door for other bacteria which may cause Crohn’s. Key take-away: Bacteria. An abnormal balance of gut bacteria.47 The use of antibiotics may disturb the normal bacterial ecosystem, which in turn may open the door to bad bacteria which may cause Crohn’s. Key take-away: Bacteria. At closer analysis, it seems that 3 of the 4 potential causes lean towards some or other bacterial involvement. Maybe this observation can bring us closer to a tenable answer as to a potential cause to be addressed when supporting and complimenting a normal treatment regime. Step 2: A closer look at potential bacterial candidates Based on the information gained in Step 1, let’s take a closer look at some suspicious bacteria that might be a source of concern. Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP): MAP is a bacterial parasite that has long been considered to be a potential cause of Crohn's disease.48, 50, 51 Evidence in support of the hypothesis that MAP is a causative agent for Crohn's disease was reported as far back as the 1980’s. A study performed by Patterson et al (2021) found that there was evidence that MAP is highly associated with Crohn’s disease.52 Clostridioides (clostridium) difficile (c. diff): C. diff is an anaerobic gram-positive, spore-forming, bacterium that causes intestinal diseases varying from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis.51 C. diff infection (CDI) is a leading health concern worldwide.49 C. diff is responsible for 20% - 30% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and 50% - 75% of cases of antibiotic associated colitis.51 IBD has been found to be associated with C. diff. People most often get C. diff infection after taking antibiotics that killed off other, helpful bacteria.49 This allows C. diff to spread quickly. C. diff is very hard to kill. They are resistant to heat, acid and many antibiotics and disinfectants.49 Although it is still not clear whether C. diff is a cause of IBD or a consequence of the inflammatory state in the intestinal environment, it is generally accepted that C. diff is somehow involved in Crohn’s disease.51 Antibiotic and other treatments: Antibiotic use can have several negative effects on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Antibiotic use may disrupt the normal bacterial ecosystem and thereby trigger new infections such as C. diff.54 Step 3: Why Zoilevium PureGut may be an effective support system. Zoilevium PureGut has the properties of a broad spectrum, inorganic, metallo-antibiotic. This means that it is a mineral-based antimicrobial compound produced by using bioinorganic chemistry.32, 42, 43 The value of minerals to our health is common knowledge and not disputed. Three of the various ingredients used in Zoilevium PureGut are magnesium, copper and zinc. These minerals have the following attributes that may act in supporting IBD and IBS treatments: Magnesium55 Magnesium is a nutrient that the body needs to stay healthy. Magnesium is important for many processes in the body, including regulating muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure and making protein, bone, and DNA.56 It is a vital mineral that is involved in hundreds of enzyme-related reactions in the human body.57, 58 New research confirms the antibacterial properties of magnesium.57, 58 It contributes to normal electrolyte balance. It contributes to tissue formation. It has a role in the process of cell division. It is a factor in the maintenance of good health. Copper55 Copper is an essential trace element which is involved in numerous biological processes.6, 7 It helps to produce and repair connective tissue. It contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. It contributes to the normal function of the immune system. It helps to produce and repair connective tissue. It helps to form red blood cells. It is a factor in the maintenance of good health. The anti-inflammatory activity of copper complexes has been known for several decades and has been used to treat inflammatory disorders.20 Copper is a very effective antimicrobial which employs various modes of action to kill pathogens.59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 Tests show that copper was able to kill Clostridium difficile bacteria in 10 minutes to 2 hours.68, 69 Zinc55 Zinc is the 2nd most prevalent vestigial element in the human body, and it is essential for individuals to remain healthy. Since excess Zinc is not stored in the body, it must be consumed regularly as part of a healthy diet.15, 70 It helps in connective tissue formation. It contributes to normal acid-base metabolism. It contributes to normal DNA synthesis. It is a factor in the maintenance of good health. It contributes to normal macronutrient metabolism. It contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. It has a role in the process of cell division. It is critical to the formation of protective epithelial barriers (gut lining).71 It helps your immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses.70, 71 It helps with your body’s anti-inflammatory response.72, 73 Zinc is a very effective antimicrobial which employs various modes of action to kill pathogens.59, 60, 74, 75, 76 Zinc oxide (ZnO) appears to have a strong protective effect in resisting intestinal diseases.72, 73, 77, 78 Conclusion The Zoilevium PureGut minerals aid the conventional IBS treatment in the following ways: They help the body maintain a healthy immune system. This helps the body fight off unwanted pathogens, like those causing IBD and IBS.43 They help with tissue formation which helps the healing process of damage to the intestinal linings that are caused by IBD and IBS infections. They help with the keeping of general gut health. The antimicrobial properties help in killing potential IBD and IBS bacterial causes like Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and Clostridioides (clostridium) difficile and/or other causative bacteria. It is therefore clear that there is academic, scientific and “logically deduced inferences to the best explanation” reasons to believe that Zoilevium PureGut may be a valuable add-on to a normal treatment regime for IBD and IBS as well as to the general maintenance of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. 1.2 ZOILEVIUM TOPICAL General, Topical Antiseptic and Antibacterial Treatment Zoilevium Topical is a mineral-based antimicrobial and disinfectant compound that has the properties and modes of action of a broad spectrum, inorganic, metallo-antibiotic. The number of effective antibiotics is steadily decreasing, and to the extent that in future there may be no antibiotics left that can successfully combat infections.79 Today, drug-resistant infections are a serious threat to people’s (and global) health. If modern medicine wants to continue as a solution to infections, the discovery of new antibiotics able to kill drug-resistant bacteria, is essential.80 What is antimicrobial resistance? Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, and other organisms develop a way to prevent antimicrobial drugs (like antibiotics) from effectively killing them or controlling their growth.81, 82 As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective, and pathogens do not respond to the drugs designed to kill them. This means that infections that used to be treatable can become increasingly difficult or impossible to treat.81, 83 The number of effective antibiotics is steadily decreasing, and to such an extent that in future there may be no antibiotics left that can successfully combat infections.79 The potential scope of the problem is so great that the WHO says that without urgent action, the world is heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.82, 84, 85 Unfortunately, no new classes of antibiotics have been discovered since the 1980s. A class means a type of antibiotic that works in a certain way, for example attacking a specific germ function (this is called its mode of action).6, 34, 80, 86 However, due to the prevalence of AMR, the search for new classes of antibacterial agents has now spread to the likes of metal ions, nanoparticles, and metal compounds.87, 88 The future of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) treatment Evans and Kavanagh34 published a paper in which they investigated the use of metals as antibacterial agents. They say that metals have a history of antibacterial uses, but with the discovery of antibiotics became overlooked and effectively discarded and ignored. According to them, metal-based antibacterial compounds have novel modes of action that may provide an advantage in the treatment of bacterial infections with resistance to conventional antibiotics. An ideal novel antibacterial compound must be able to combat both the acquired and the intrinsic resistance mechanisms of bacteria.33 Metal-based antibacterial compounds have been proposed as a candidate for the development of a novel class of antibiotics for the effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.34, 35 Why metal-based antibacterial compounds We’ve known for a long time that various metals are effective in killing microbes and that metals have commonly been used for antibacterial purposes.34, 89, 90 With the rise in AMR and the difficulties in producing antibiotics with novel modes of action, research into the use of metal-based pharmaceuticals as antimicrobial agents has resurfaced and is gaining popularity.34 An advantage to the use of metal-based antibiotics is their diverse modes of action compared to conventional organic antibiotics.32, 34, 35, 42, 91, 92, 93 Therefore, the use of these metal-based complexes alone or in combination with antibiotics holds promise as an effective treatment against resistant microbial infections through these novel and additional modes of action.34, 35, 42 The following minerals are part of the ingredients found in Zoilevium Topical and are well known for their antimicrobial properties: Magnesium Magnesium is a vital mineral that is involved in hundreds of enzyme-related reactions in the human body.94, 95 In the last few years, new research is emerging showing the antibacterial properties of magnesium.57, 58, 96, 97 Recent research has found that Magnesium has the ability to impair bacterial adhesion and formation of complex communities of bacterial cells called biofilms. It has been hypothesized that the Magnesium ions affect the membranes of bacterial cells causing them to be “leakier”.98 Studies found that coating different surfaces with magnesium or magnesium compounds had the effect of reducing the presence of bacteria and biofilm.57 Copper The antibacterial effect of copper on a wide range of pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, has been demonstrated by many laboratory studies.61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103 Furthermore, apart from being an effective antimicrobial agent, exposure to copper has been correlated with enhanced wound healing.100, 104, 105 Research has further shown that many disease-causing bacteria such as E. coli, hospital superbugs, and several viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) are susceptible to exposure to copper surfaces.106 How copper kills Research has shown that copper works in several different ways to shut down bacterial cells’ chemistry and physiology. Copper, through copper oxide, kills germs through three main pathways, with five total modes of action available at any time it comes into contact with cells. Any of these five kill methods can destroy bacteria, and overlapping mechanisms can also prevent, or at the very least, make developing resistance much more challenging.68, 107, 108, 109, 110 Copper can kill bacteria and viruses in any of the following ways:68, 110, 111 It has the ability to disrupt the protective layers of certain microorganisms and interfering with their vital processes. It disrupts bacterial cell membranes, damaging the DNA or RNA of the microbe. It generates ferociously reactive oxidative stress on bacterial cells and develops hydrogen peroxide, which can kill bacteria cells. It interferes with critical proteins that operate important functions that keep bacterial cells alive. Zinc It's long been known that Zinc plays an important role in the body's ability to protect against bacterial infection.110, 113, 114 Researchers have found that Zinc can 'starve' bacteria by preventing its uptake of an essential metal, namely Manganese, that bacteria need to be able to invade and cause disease in humans.115 Zinc interferes with a protein transporter in the bacteria so that it cannot absorb Manganese. Without Manganese, bacteria can more easily be cleared by the natural immune system.114, 116 There is also sufficient evidence in the literature to indicate that zinc-ions have multiple inhibitory effects on bacterial cell activities. A vast number of published studies have used zinc-oxide nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent. ZnO-NPs can disturb the bacterial growth either by interacting with the bacterial surface or entering inside the bacterial cells leading to the disruption of bacterial enzyme systems.117 Zinc-oxide also combats bacterial infection in a non-direct antibacterial way by protecting cells, inhibiting bacterial adhesion, preventing the disruption of barrier integrity, helping to decrease permeability, increasing the tightness of junctions so that bacteria can’t make their way through, and reducing inflammation through modulating cytokine gene expressions.77 Zinc can also act as an antiviral agent by preventing the replication of RNA viruses. It does this by inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), an enzyme that causes the replication of RNA viruses, like the coronavirus. Additionally, Zinc plays a role in modulating the interferon response. Interferon is a molecule that leads the immune response against viral infections. Zinc helps the body produce interferon when a virus is detected, and then dials down the immune response when the infection is cleared.118 Dr. Christopher McDevitt, of the University of Adelaide, calls Zinc “nature's antimicrobial”.116 Conclusions Metal-based antibacterial complexes have several advantages over conventional antibiotics, making them an important candidate for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.119 Metal complexes have access to multiple and novel modes of action, which may prevent and/or hinder the development of antibiotic resistance, as bacteria must develop multiple mechanisms of resistance against the metal-based antibiotic.34, 35 It is not far-fetched to think that metal-based antibacterial compounds could become a more prevalent solution in the medical treatment of bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics.34, 35 The Zoilevium Topical minerals aid in the fight against persistent topical infections in the following way: They help with tissue formation which helps the healing process of damaged skin and open wounds. The powerful antimicrobial properties help in killing the infectious bacteria and thereby giving the body the opportunity to heal the wound effectively. It is therefore clear that there is abundant academic and scientific backing for the view that Zoilevium Topical has the characteristics and modes of action to act like a powerful broad spectrum, inorganic, topical metallo-antibiotic and disinfectant that can assist in combatting hard-to-treat topical/open wound infections. 2 CATEGORY 2 – IMMUNE SUPPORT 2.1 ZOILEVIUM IMMUNE SUPPORT Immune Supporting Mineral Supplement for General Well-being Zoilevium Immune Support is a mineral-based supplement with additional antimicrobial properties that is produced using bioinorganic chemistry.32, 41 The value of minerals to our health is common knowledge and not disputed. Three of the ingredients used in Zoilevium Immune Support are magnesium, copper, and zinc. These minerals have the following attributes that may improve general well-being by supporting the immune system while the antimicrobial properties help the body fight unwanted infections: Magnesium Magnesium is a nutrient that the body needs to stay healthy. Magnesium is important for many processes in the body, including regulating muscle and nerve function, blood glucose levels, and blood pressure. It is also involved in making protein, bone, and DNA.56 Magnesium is a cofactor in more than 300 enzyme systems that regulate diverse biochemical reactions in the body.120 Magnesium is also known to contribute to the following:55 It contributes to normal electrolyte balance. It contributes to tissue formation. It contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism. It helps to metabolise carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It contributes to normal functioning of the nervous system. It contributes to the development and maintenance of bones and teeth. It contributes to a reduction of tiredness and fatigue. It contributes to the maintenance of normal muscle function. It contributes to normal protein synthesis. It contributes to normal psychological function. It has a role in the process of cell division. It is a factor in the maintenance of good health. It has effective antimicrobial properties with unique modes of action.56, 57, 96, 97 Copper Copper is an essential mineral which is involved in numerous biological processes.15 Copper is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in energy production, iron metabolism, neuropeptide activation, and connective tissue synthesis. Copper is also involved in many physiological processes, such as angiogenesis, regulation of gene expression, brain development, and immune system functioning.122 Copper is also known to contribute to the following:55, 122, 123 It helps to produce and repair connective tissue. It contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. It contributes to the normal function of the immune system. It helps to form red blood cells. It contributes to normal iron transport and metabolism. It contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism. It contributes to normal functioning of the nervous system. It is a factor in the maintenance of good health. The anti-inflammatory activity of copper complexes has been known for several decades and has been used to treat inflammatory disorders.15 Copper is a very effective antimicrobial which employs various modes of action to kill pathogens.61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 123 Zinc Zinc is the most influential trace mineral, as it plays a role in over 300 enzyme systems and is a key component in over 3000 proteins in the body – more than any other trace mineral. It is a key component and building block in the immune system.71 Zinc is also the 2nd most prevalent vestigial element in the human body, and it is essential for individuals to remain healthy.124, 125, 126 Studies have found that Zn(II) supplementation therapies have proven to be effective in reducing the incidence of respiratory infections.127, 128, 129, 130, 131 Since excess Zinc is not stored in the body, it must be consumed regularly as part of a healthy diet.15, 70 Zinc is also known to contribute to the following:55, 132 It contributes to the maintenance of immune function. It helps in connective tissue formation. It contributes to normal acid-base metabolism. It contributes to normal DNA synthesis. It is a factor in the maintenance of good health. It contributes to normal macronutrient metabolism. It contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. It has a role in the process of cell division. It contributes to normal cognitive function. It contributes to the maintenance of normal testosterone levels in the blood. It contributes to normal fertility and reproduction. It helps your immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses.70 Zinc is a very effective antimicrobial which employs various modes of action to kill pathogens.112, 113, 114, 133, 134, 135, 136 Conclusion The mineral composition of Zoilevium Immune Support promotes a healthier body in the following ways: It helps the body maintain a healthy immune system. This helps the body fight off unwanted pathogens, and attacks that may cause illness. It helps with various functions as discussed above which contribute to a healthier body. Because of the unique antimicrobial properties of the ingredients, many bacterial and viral infections may be dealt with before they have the opportunity to incubate and start causing illness. Because the optimal ratio between Zinc and Copper are used in the product, these antagonistic minerals are able to provide maximum efficacy. It contributes to general health and well-being. It should therefore be clear that there is academic and scientific backing that establishes the success expectations of Zoilevium Immune Support’s potential contribution to a healthier body, a stronger immune system, and a pre-emptive defense against various attacks from pathogens. Imagine the effect on general well-being after using a mineral supplement that gives the inherent advantages of the associated minerals, but also acts pre-emptively on pathogens due to its powerful broad spectrum, inorganic, metallo-antibiotic properties.

Grammar and spelling may have been adjusted for clarity purposes. Linda Dugmore 75 years old Pretoria, South Africa. 2024/04/09 I am an elderly lady of 75 who was feeling 120 years old. I suffered from digestive problems, chronic pain in my hands and wrists from arthritis, as well as overall aches and pains due to fibromyalgia. I was permanently tired, to the extent that most days I could hardly get out of bed. I was told about the potential positive effects of the Zoilevium Immune Support product from a nephew in Portugal. He in turn had seen excellent health results in a friend who had been battling with digestive problems. I ordered the product, and I have had amazing results with all my problems. My chronic pain has very significantly reduced. My energy levels have also significantly increased. To the extent that I have started working around the house and in my garden again. I now regard the product as part of my daily, necessary, routine. Thank you Zoilevium! Sarah Motsemmi 42 years old Potchefstroom, South Africa. 2024/05/20 I used to suffer from chronic headaches. I was on permanent pain medication. This overuse of medication started to cause kidney problems and kidney pain. My employer was used to me asking for pain medication in addition to the self-medication I was on. A client of ours introduced me to Zoilevium Immune Support and out of pure desperation I decided to try the product. I started to experience results after about 3 weeks of use. I am now totally headache free. This has had the knock-on effect of stopping my kidney pain and problems as I no longer use pain medicine. I use Zoilevium Immune Support on a permanent basis now and have put my family on the product as well. Thank you so much to Zoilevium Anonymous male London, United Kingdom. 2023/10/18 After receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, my health deteriorated dramatically. I was given chemotherapy for approximately 6-months, followed by dialysis for 6-months. I ended up with such swollen legs and constant pain that I was bed ridden for around a year. Family and friends regarded my situation as extremely dire, even terminal, before the Zoilevium intervention changed everything I was introduced to Zoilevium Immune Support by my neighbour. After using the product for 3 weeks I felt like a new person. I made a full recovery. I was able to get up out of bed and walk and move normally again. My general health returned to normal, and I was able to resume normal activities. Anonymous male 68 years old Parys, South Africa. 2024/04/25 I started experiencing numbness in my left arm, hand and fingers. I lost feeling in some fingers and experienced a pins and needles sensation in fingers and parts of my hand. This continued for a period of around 2 years. A friend introduced me to Zoilevium Immune Support. I used the product daily for a period of about 3 weeks after which I started noticing an improvement to my condition. After 4 to 5 weeks all discomfort was gone and I could move and use my hand normally again. The numbness and pins and needles sensation had disappeared. A product I can highly recommend as a daily supplement for general wellness."

Grammar and spelling may have been adjusted for clarity purposes. Tom van Deventer 65 years old Stilfontein, South Africa. 2021/05/12 I underwent a knee replacement. The wound became septic and had puss oozing out of the wound on a permanent basis. Doctors tried everything possible to stop the infection. I also visited a wound clinic on a regular basis, but it didn’t help. After close to 2 years of battling the infection I reached the stage where my doctor suggested amputating the leg to prevent the sepsis from spreading any further. I started using Zoilevium Topical which I started squirting into the septic wound. After 8 days the sepsis was gone. I am so grateful for this product saving my leg.

Henry Snyman 68 years old Pretoria, South Africa. 2024/01/15 I was bitten by mosquitoes while on holiday in Mozambique. Due to all the scratching, the bites got infected. When I got back to South Africa I went to see my doctor to attend to the infection. After 2 weeks of medical treatment, which included antibiotics, antibiotic cream, bee-cream and physical scrubbing of the wound with a brush, the infection was still there. I used Zoilevium Topical which cleared up the infection within 3 days. Thank you so much. Zoilevium is now the first thing I pack when going holiday camping.

Shirley van Wyk 64 years old Hartswater, South Africa. 2024/02/25 I was diagnosed with throat cancer and had to be incubated with an endotracheal tube. The wound around the tube got infected to such an extent that large amounts of puss was oozing out of the wound daily. Nothing that was done by the doctors or myself could stop the puss. I started using Zoilevium and found immediate relief. After 2 days there was no sign of any puss on the outside of the wound. A product I would HIGHLY recommend.

After 9 days of medical treatment, which included antibiotics and antibiotic cream, there was no relief. The area was extremely sore and was getting bigger. My mother suggested using Zoilevium as she had had great results in the past with the product. I squirted the product into the septic area and experienced relief almost immediately. After 2 days all the pain was gone and the infected area looked much better. A product I highly recommend. Before: Warning: This content may be sensitive. Click to view.

Rentia Claasen 66 years old Klerksdorp, South Africa. 2021/11/20 I was struggling with an open wound that was constantly infected and just would not heal. Doctors and wound clinics couldn’t help with the problem. Over a period of 10 years, I tried every medication and every home remedy I could find, but to no avail. The wound became so bad that I was confined to a wheelchair most of the time. I was referred to Zoilevium by a friend of mine. I used the product diligently for a period of 12 months. The wound is completely closed and healed. An amazing product I have recommended to all my friends. Before: Warning: This content may be sensitive. Click to view.

After 3 months of doctors and wound clinics I was worried that the infection would eventually consume my whole foot. I heard of Zoilevium from a friend and started using the product. After around 3 weeks the toes had healed, and the apparent infection was gone. A product I would highly recommend. Before: Warning: This content may be sensitive. Click to view.

All information I reveal is done with the consent of the patient concerned. The lady came to us with a big open wound on her stomach. All our standard treatments did not yield results. Out of desperation I decided to use Zoilevium Topical which a former patient had told me of, and who had reported great results with the product. The improvement over a period of 2 weeks was amazing. I have been a practicing nurse for around 38 years and am very impressed with the product. I now refer to it as our magic potion. Highly recommended. Before: Warning: This content may be sensitive.

The toe got infected and wouldn’t heal. I heard of Zoilevium from my gym coach. I started using the spray and got amazing results. I struggled with the injury for 7 months with no joy. The Zoilevium spray cleared up the infection and helped the wound to heal within 3 weeks. Unfortunately, lots of damage to the toe occurred during the 7 months. I really wish I had started using the product earlier. Awesome product!!! Before: Warning: This content may be sensitive. Click to view. After 3 days: Warning: This content may be sensitive.
